# Working groups 

Working groups are subteams of the napari community formed by members interested in diving deep on a particular topic (ex:‘Bundled Application’, ‘Documentation’) that meet on a semi-regular cadence to discuss, implement, and track ideas over time. 

## Working group guidelines

We believe working groups are helpful ways of moving forward work on particular topics, and the following guidelines serve to help team members form and/or maintain healthy working groups. Working groups should:

- Identify at least one “lead”, responsible for the creation and continuation of the group, and one [core developer](https://napari.org/community/team.html#current-core-developers) “sponsor” who is kept aware of work and can help shepherd through PRs as needed. All other membership is opt-in.
- Create a “charter” that describes working group’s core focus and goals, holds meeting minutes, lists membership/zulip channel/meeting schedule. 
- Identify achievable goals and deliverables that map thoughtfully to napari’s larger strategies and [roadmap](https://napari.org/roadmaps/index.html).
- Hold regular public meetings that are listed on the [napari community calendar](https://napari.org/community/team.html#meeting-schedule). Cadence is up to the team, but monthly minimum is recommended.
- Maintain and publicly store the working group’s meeting minutes in [napari/meeting-notes](https://github.com/napari/meeting-notes).
- Present updates at least once per month at a napari community meeting (done by at least one working group member).
- Have members actively working towards goals set forth in the charter.
- Reach out to and collaborate with other open source communities to bring new expertise to the project (when relevant).

## How to join an existing working group

Membership is optional and opt-in, and you can join by attending group meetings (which can be found on the [napari community calendar](https://napari.org/community/team.html#meeting-schedule)) and/or reaching out to the working group lead.

## How to start a new working group

1. Check the existing working groups list (above) to make sure the problem space is unique.
2. Propose working group on [napari’s main zulip](https://napari.zulipchat.com) and schedule meeting to begin charter creation (live or asynchronously).
3. Complete charter with associated items (lead identification, summary focus, meeting time, etc) and share with group.
4. Set up zulip channel, add group and associated items to this site, and add meeting to napari community calendar. 
5. Collaborate with others and get working. After each meeting, store the working group’s meeting minutes in [napari/meeting-notes](https://github.com/napari/meeting-notes).
6. Share out at the next community meeting. Boom, you’ve done it!
