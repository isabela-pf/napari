# Working Groups  
Working groups are subteams of the napari community formed by members interested in diving deep on a particular topic (ex:‘Bundled Application’, ‘Documentation’) that meet on a semi-regular cadence to discuss, implement, and track ideas over time. 


## Working group guidelines
We believe working groups are helpful ways of moving forward work on particular topics, and the following guidelines serve to help team members form and/or maintain healthy working groups. Working groups should:

- Identify at least one “lead”, responsible for the creation and continuation of the group, and one core developer “sponsor” who is kept aware of work and can help shepherd through PRs as needed. All other membership is opt-in.
- Create a “charter” that describes working group’s core focus and goals, holds meeting minutes, lists membership/zulip channel/meeting schedule. 
- Identify achievable goals and deliverables that map thoughtfully to napari’s larger strategies and roadmap.
- Hold regular public meetings that are listed on the napari community calendar. Cadence is up to the team, but monthly minimum is recommended.
- Maintain and publicly store the working group’s meeting minutes
- Present updates at least one of the napari community meeting per month (done by at least one working group member)
- Have members actively working towards goals set forth in the charter
- Reach out to and collaborate with other open source communities to bring new expertise to the project (when relevant).

Working groups are to
- Have a regular public meeting and have it posted on the napari community calendar. 
Required meeting frequency is still a question here. I personally think a minimum of once a month sounds fair to account for any unusual events without disbanding a working group right away. Meeting at least every other week does sound like it'd be more helpful on a regular basis though.

- Create (and regularly—like annually—reevaluate) a working group charter that includes actionable goals
- Present updates at at least one of the napari community meetings (done by at least one working group member)
- Maintain and publicly store the working group’s meeting minutes
- Have members actively working towards goals set forth in the charter
- Reach out to an collaborate with other open source communities to bring new expertise to the project (when relevant)
- Collect user-centric questions that might be suited towards a user experience research survey.
- Have a way for the community to stay in contact with/work with people who work on napari as a job to make sure there is support for any tasks that might take a lot of bandwidth.
